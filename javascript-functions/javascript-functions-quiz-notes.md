- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a function is a tool used to reproduce a section of code
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword to begin the creation of a new function.
  An optional name. (Our function's name is sayHello.)
  A comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by () parentheses. (Our sayHello function doesn't have any parameters.)
  The start of the function's code block, as indicated by an { opening curly brace.
  An optional return statement. (Our sayHello function doesn't have a return statement.)
  The end of the function's code block, as indicated by a } closing curly brace.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  the functions name with arguments inputted in the parenthese
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  the differences is one is defining what the function will do, action, with call defining how that action will react
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  parameter is what is fed into the definition of the function to allow for manipulation of said argument, with the argument being what is called into the function.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  due to the fact that they are a versatile variable that is unknown and can be manipulated before the function call without messing up the code base.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
  Prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
